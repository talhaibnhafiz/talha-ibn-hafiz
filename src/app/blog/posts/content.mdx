## Abstract

In developing countries like Bangladesh, small textile factories often dump untreated waste because pollution control systems are too expensive. To address this, a low-cost prototype, named 'Integrated Eco-Factory', was designed and fabricated. This system simultaneously performs three critical functions: carbon capture, wastewater treatment, and energy harvesting: captures carbon soot from chimneys, treats wastewater, and harvests renewable energy.First, a cyclonic separator was utilized to collect carbon soot from exhaust gas and processed it into printing ink. Laboratory analysis revealed that the synthesized ink has a viscosity of 3.2 cP and surface tension of $38.5~mN/m,$ which is very close to commercial printer ink. Second, the traditional biological treatment was replaced with an Electrocoagulation (EC) unit. This unit removed 98% of the dye color from the water. Instead of throwing away the sludge we used it to make "Eco-Bricks" that have a strength of 14.2 MPa, making them safe for construction use. Finally, to ensure energy autonomy, a hybrid energy system (Solar, Thermal, and Hydro) that generates about 950 Wh per day enough to run the system's sensors and IoT monitoring 24/7.Our cost analysis shows that a factory can recover the full setup cost in just 7 months by selling the ink and bricks. The results demonstrate that that pollution control can be profitable for small industries.

### Personal details

My personal details are used across the whole app to render personalized headings, labels and images. Languages are displayed on the `/about` page, and location and time in the header.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    highlight="2-3,7-10"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`const person = {
    firstName: "Talha",
    lastName: "Ibn Hafiz",
    get name() {
      return \`\${this.firstName} \${this.lastName}\`;
    },

    languages: ["English", "Bengali"],
};`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "src/app/resources/content.js"
  }
]} />

### Social links

Social links are rendered on the `/about` page and in the footer based on the array configured in the `social` object. You can set custom icons to each, but don't forget to import them in `src/once-ui/icons.ts`.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`const social = [
    {
      name: "GitHub",
      icon: "github",
      link: "https://github.com/talhaibnhafiz",
    },
    {
      name: "Email",
      icon: "email",
      link: "mailto:talhaibnhafiz2007@gmail.com", 
    },
];`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "src/app/resources/content.js"
  }
]} />

### Pages

Each page have it's own object that manages the personalized content, such as headings, subheadings, images and dynamic data.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`const home = {
    label: "Home",
    title: "Talha Ibn Hafiz's Portfolio",
    description: "Software enthusiast specializing in Sustainable Manufacturing and Industry 5.0",
    headline: <>Building the future with <InlineCode>EcoFactory</InlineCode></>,
    subline: (
      <>
        I'm Talha, a CS enthusiast and researcher focusing on 
        sustainable manufacturing. I bridge the gap between 
        <br /> technology and environmental efficiency through Industry 5.0.
      </>
    ),
};`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "src/app/resources/content.js"
  }
]} />

The `label` property is used in the header navigation. The `title` property is used for the page title and the `description` property is used for the page description.
