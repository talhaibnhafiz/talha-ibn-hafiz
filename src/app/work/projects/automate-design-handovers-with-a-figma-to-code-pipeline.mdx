## Overview

In developing countries like Bangladesh, small-scale textile factories (SMEs) often struggle with waste management due to high costs. My project, the **'Integrated Eco-Factory'**, offers a low-cost solution. It is a multi-functional system designed to capture carbon emissions, treat wastewater, and generate its own energy. The core philosophy is **"Waste-to-Resource"**—turning harmful pollutants into sellable products to make environmental protection profitable for small industries.

## Key Features

- **Carbon-to-Ink Conversion**: Using a cyclonic separator, the system captures carbon soot from factory chimneys and processes it into high-quality printing ink (viscosity 3.2 cP), suitable for commercial use.
- **Advanced Wastewater Treatment**: Replaces expensive biological methods with an **Electrocoagulation (EC)** unit, achieving a 98% removal rate of dye color from industrial water.
- **Sustainable Eco-Bricks**: Instead of discarding sludge, the system converts it into 'Eco-Bricks' with a compressive strength of 14.2 MPa, meeting safety standards for construction.
- **Energy Autonomy & IoT**: A hybrid energy system (Solar, Thermal, and Hydro) generates 950 Wh/day, powering the system’s sensors and providing 24/7 real-time IoT monitoring.

## Technologies Used

- **Electrocoagulation (EC)**: For efficient and chemical-free wastewater purification.
- **Cyclonic Separation**: For mechanical filtration of carbon soot from exhaust gases.
- **IoT & Sensors**: For real-time monitoring of water quality and energy production.
- **Hybrid Energy Harvesting**: Integration of Solar PV, Thermoelectric generators, and Hydro-turbines.
- **Lab Analysis**: Viscosity and surface tension testing for ink, and compressive strength testing for bricks.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the primary challenges was ensuring the synthesized ink met commercial standards. I had to experiment extensively with surface tension ($38.5~mN/m$) and viscosity to ensure it wouldn't clog printer heads. Another significant learning curve was optimizing the Electrocoagulation unit to work effectively at a low cost. This project taught me the importance of **Circular Economy** and how hardware engineering can solve critical environmental issues in resource-constrained settings.

## Outcome

The Integrated Eco-Factory proves that pollution control can be a profitable venture. Cost analysis shows that a factory can recover the entire setup cost in just **7 months** by selling the produced ink and eco-bricks. By removing 98% of water pollutants and capturing carbon, this system provides a scalable roadmap for sustainable industrialization in Bangladesh and beyond.
