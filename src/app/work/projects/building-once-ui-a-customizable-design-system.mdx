## Overview

The **Smart IoT Helmet** project was born out of a need to reduce road accident fatalities by ensuring faster emergency response. It is a wearable safety device that monitors the rider's condition and the helmet's status in real-time. By integrating various sensors with an ESP32 microcontroller, the helmet can automatically detect a crash and notify emergency contacts with the exact location.

## Key Features

- **Accident Detection**: Uses an **MPU6050 (Accelerometer & Gyroscope)** to detect sudden impacts or falls, triggering an immediate emergency protocol.
- **Drunk Driving Prevention**: Integrated **MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor** prevents the bike from starting if the rider is intoxicated (via ignition interlock simulation).
- **Automatic SOS Alerts**: In case of an accident, a **GSM/GPS module** sends a distress SMS containing the Google Maps link of the accident site to predefined numbers.
- **Smart Cloud Integration**: All data is synced to a mobile app using **Blynk or Firebase**, allowing family members to track the rider's safety status.

## Technologies Used

- **Microcontroller**: ESP32 / Arduino Nano.
- **Sensors**: MPU6050 (Motion), MQ-3 (Alcohol), GPS Neo-6M (Location).
- **Communication**: GSM SIM800L for SMS and Cellular data.
- **Software**: C++, Arduino IDE, Blynk Cloud IoT platform.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was filtering out false alarms (e.g., when the helmet is simply dropped). I solved this by implementing a threshold-based algorithm that requires both high G-force and a specific tilt angle to trigger an SOS. This project deepened my understanding of real-time data processing and the reliability of IoT devices in critical safety applications.

## Outcome

The prototype successfully reduced the time to alert emergency services to less than 30 seconds after an impact. It serves as a proof of concept for how affordable IoT technology can be integrated into standard safety gear to save lives.
