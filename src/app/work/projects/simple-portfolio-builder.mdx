## Overview

As part of my 'Integrated Eco-Factory' research, I developed a specific module to tackle air pollution: **Carbon to Ink**. Instead of letting carbon soot from textile factory chimneys escape into the atmosphere, this system captures it and transforms it into a valuable raw material. This project proves that environmental sustainability can be economically profitable for small-scale industries.

## Key Features

- **Cyclonic Carbon Capture**: Utilizes a mechanical cyclonic separator to extract fine carbon particles from industrial exhaust gases without needing expensive filters.
- **Chemical Synthesis**: The captured soot is processed using a specific ratio of binders and solvents to achieve a viscosity of **3.2 cP**, making it compatible with standard printers.
- **Quality Benchmarking**: Laboratory tests showed a surface tension of **38.5 mN/m**, which is remarkably close to premium commercial printer inks.
- **Circular Economy Model**: This process turns a hazardous waste product into a revenue stream, helping factories offset the cost of pollution control.

## Technologies Used

- **Mechanical Engineering**: Cyclonic Separator design and fabrication.
- **Chemical Processing**: Stabilization and mixing of carbon pigments.
- **Analytical Tools**: Viscometers and Tensiometers for quality control.
- **Sustainable Design**: Focus on low-energy consumption during the conversion process.

## Challenges and Learnings

The biggest hurdle was achieving the right consistency so the ink wouldn't clog or dry up inside the printer heads. I had to conduct multiple trials to find the perfect balance of viscosity and surface tension. This project taught me the intricate chemistry behind everyday products and how engineering can create a closed-loop waste management system.

## Outcome

The resulting ink was successfully used for printing on paper and fabric. Our cost-benefit analysis indicates that the sale of this synthesized ink, along with other eco-factory products, allows factories to recover their initial investment within just **7 months**.

This project is a testament to how innovative engineering can turn a global problem (pollution) into a local solution (ink).
